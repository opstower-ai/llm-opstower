An AWS CLI AI assistant that can answer questions about your AWS resources and perform calculations on cloudwatch metrics from the command line.

## Installation

Installed as a plugin for [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/), A CLI utility for interacting with LLMs.

Install `llm` if you haven't yet:

```bash
pip install llm

```bash
 llm keys set opstower
```

Make `opstower` your default model:

```

## Usage

```bash

```

See [some example questions](https://gist.github.com/itsderek23/300fb4184c10895f82a9b9eb62fabd60) the agent has been evaluated with and the [evaluation results](https://www.opstower.ai/2023-evaluating-ai-agents/).

I'll fetch all the EC2 instances and calculate their average CPU utilization.

Generating AWS SDK code...this will take up to 60 seconds...

The average CPU utilization of your EC2 instances is approximately 40.12%.
