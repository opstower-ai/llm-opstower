## Installation

Installed as a plugin for [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/), A CLI utility for interacting with LLMs.

Install `llm` if you haven't yet:

```bash
pip install llm
```

Install the OpsTower plugin:

```bash
llm install https://github.com/opstower-ai/llm-opstower/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

Set your API key.
When prompted, provide your API key in the form of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`:

```bash
 llm keys set opstower
```

Make `opstower` your default model:

```bash
llm models default opstower
```

## Usage

```bash
llm "What is the average CPU utilization of my EC2 instances?"
```

See [some example questions](https://gist.github.com/itsderek23/300fb4184c10895f82a9b9eb62fabd60) the agent has been evaluated with and the [evaluation results](https://www.opstower.ai/2023-evaluating-ai-agents/).

## Demo Mode

You can execute commands against a demonstration AWS account that contains an EC2 instance, RDS instance, an Application Load Balancer, several Lambda functions, S3 buckets, and more. 

Set the opstower key to `demo` when prompted:

```bash
llm keys set opstower
```

## Example output:

```text
% llm 'What is the average CPU utilization of my EC2 instances?'

Log:
https://app.opstower.ai/chats/d98adf29-3973-4352-805a-8232e1c97367/transcript

I'll fetch all the EC2 instances and calculate their average CPU utilization.

Generating AWS SDK code...this will take up to 60 seconds...

The average CPU utilization of your EC2 instances is approximately 40.12%.
```

```bash
llm uninstall llm-opstower
